# VCP3D_Open

This is an open-source version of an in-house single-block discontinuous Galerkin (DG-)Finite Element Method (FEM) code developed by Edwin van der Weide. My current contribution was to extend its capabilities, such that it is able handle open boundary via non-reflective boundary conditions (NRBCs). The NRBCs considered in this code are:

* Polynomial-Correction (PC-)Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Condition (NSCBC).
* Characteristic Matching Layer (CML).
* Sponge Layer.
